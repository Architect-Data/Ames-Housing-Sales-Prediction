# Ames-Housing-Sales-Prediction
The project is an excerpt from a famous dataset - Iowa Ames Housing Dataset by Dean De Cock in 2011 that provides a snapshot of the housing market between 2006 and 2010. The project aims to explore and predict housing prices. It uses different models to compare for performance. For comparison, uses RMSE. Models used in the project are linear regression, regularization, GLM, SVR, Gradient Boosting, Bagging, Random Forest and Neural Network. To see the limits of models, all models had been applied a hyperparameter that fits the tools and results, SVR and Gradient Boosting to be a good performaner with less processing power with Neural Network being the strongest.
